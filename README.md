# Moodify
Till Check point-1 I did the reading part that is required for the project, below I have attached the weekly completed reading material links and along with these I have watched some youtube tutorials based on the reading material of that particular week. From Checkpoint 1 to 2 I learned about reddit api and worked on preprocessing and building a pipeline. Afterwards I worked on building the model,debugging the errors and testing the model by varying the hyperparameters

# Week 1
Covered basics of neural network and artificial neural network
* https://www.w3schools.com/python/
* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/basics-of-neural-network/
* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/beginners-guide-to-artificial-neural-network/
* https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-for-beginners-by-beginners-6bfc002e13a2
* https://curiousily.com/posts/build-your-first-neural-network-with-pytorch/
* https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-code-a-simple-neural-network-in-pytorch-for-absolute-beginners-8f5209c50fdd

# Week 2
Covered the convolutional neural network
* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/convolutional-neural-networks-cnn/
* https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-for-beginners-by-beginners-6bfc002e13a2
* https://medium.com/thecyphy/train-cnn-model-with-pytorch-21dafb918f48

# Week 3
Covered the Recurrent Neural Netwroks, LSTM and GRU
* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/12/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks/
* https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/bi-directional-rnn-basics-of-lstm-and-gru-e114aa4779bb
* https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understanding-rnn-implementation-in-pytorch-eefdfdb4afdb

# Week 4
Explored the Instagram API and concluded that we can't scrap the personal feed using this API
* https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/01/30/instagram-graph-api-updates/
* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/

# Week 5
Since we will not be able to use Instagram API so we explored about Reddit API and using it
* https://github.com/ClarityCoders/RedditImageScraper
* https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

# Week 6
Searched for a text and image dataset with emotions as there labels.
Worked on Preprocessing of Data using NLP techniques like tokenization,removing stopwords and lemmatization

# Week 7
Built a pipeline without worrying about model and accuracy

# Week 8
Learnt about word embeddings and built a bidirectional LSTM model and tested it without using the pre-trained word embeddings

# Remaining weeks
Tried different types of word embeddings and changed the optimizers parameters to improve the accuracy of the model. Tried other ML models also using a different file. Also thought of changing the dataset and tried preprocessing it, discarded it because of very less size of the dataset and poor accuracy. Afterwards tried  to improve the original model. I couldn't test by using the scrapped data from reddit.
