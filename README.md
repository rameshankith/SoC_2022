Till Check point-1 we did the reading part that is required for the project, below I have attached the weekly completed reading material links and along with these I have watched some youtube tutorials based on the reading material of that particular week. From Checkpoint 1 to 2 I learned about reddit api and worked on preprocessing and building a pipeline
